    <h1>Pizza Margherita</h1>
    <img src="/images/pizza .jpeg" alt="lasgana">
    <p>
      Pizza Margherita is a classic Italian pizza made with fresh mozzarella,
      tomatoes, and basil. It is a simple pizza, but the ingredients are of the
      highest quality. The dough is made with fresh yeast and is allowed to rise
      for several hours, resulting in a light and airy crust. The tomatoes are
      pureed and seasoned with garlic and olive oil, and the mozzarella is fresh
      and shredded. The basil is added just before baking, to infuse the pizza
      with its fresh flavor.

      <li>
        1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand or with a

      </li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

      <li>1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, torn</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the dough, combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar in a large
        bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the olive oil, flour, and salt until a dough forms. Turn the
        dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes,
        until smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease a large bowl with olive oil. Place the dough in the bowl, turning
        to coat all sides with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the
        dough rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        To make the sauce, combine the crushed tomatoes, garlic, olive oil,
        salt, and pepper in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium
        heat and cook for 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down the dough and divide it in half. Roll out each half into a
        12-inch circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with a layer of lasagna noodles, breaking them to fit as needed.
      </li>
      <li>Spread with half of the ricotta cheese mixture.</li>
      <li>Top with another layer of lasagna noodles.</li>
      <li>Spread with the remaining meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Top with the remaining ricotta cheese mixture.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
      <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the
        cheese is melted and bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
